# Earthquakes and Plate Tectonics Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at educating users about the correlation between plate tectonics and earthquakes. Through interactive data visualizations, users can explore and understand the relationship between these geological phenomena. This was a final project in CSE 442: Data Visualization at the University of Washington. It was completed in a two-week time period.

## Features
* Utilizing HTML, CSS, and d3.js in JavaScript, we've developed interactive visualizations that allow users to explore earthquake data in relation to plate tectonics.
* Emphasis has been placed on user interaction to facilitate learning and engagement. Users can interact with the visualizations to gain insights and understand the concepts better.
* We've prioritized intuitive design to ensure that users can easily navigate through the visualizations and comprehend the complex geological concepts presented.
